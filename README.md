## The Simple Truth
The Simple Truth is that God loves you. Even if you do not love yourself. Even if you do not love the world. Even if you do not love God.

### He Gave
To all who were willing to accept, to those who asked, to those in need...
- You don't have to be the picture or epitome of holiness
- All you need is faith the size of a mustard seed
**I am an example**, _I have suffered_ and `but I have persevered`


```

Happy are those who know they are spiritually poor;
the kingdom of heaven belongs to them!

```
