## The Simple Truth
This blog will analyze news from a skeptic's perspective. It will look into the reporter's content, their sources with the hope of proving truths and exposing lies. 

### Media is Biased
It has been proven that mainstream media is slanted, and is a business like many others, which seek two main things:
- Increasing Profit Margin
- Increasing readership

**The Facts are the Facts**, _but can they be manipulated_ and `do we really look at the evidence the artice is based on?`


```

Fake News are everywhere. When we fail to look deeper, we fall into the trap of sensationalist media reports that are devoid of truth. 

### NY Post
is more tabloid than newspaper, yet the daily reader does not care enough to see the truth. Look deeper, ask questions, don't be led.
