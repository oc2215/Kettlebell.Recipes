## The Simple Truth
This blog will analyze news from a skeptic's perspective. It will look into the reporter's content, their sources with the hope of proving truths and exposing lies. 

### Media is Biased
It has been proven that mainstream media is slanted, and is a business like many others, which seek two main things:
- Increasing Profit Margin
- Increasing readership

**The Facts are the Facts**, _but can they be manipulated_ and `do we really look at the evidence the artice is based on?`

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/oc2215/Kettlebell.Recipes/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
